# PlayStation Home MiniTool
 A tool to aid for PlayStation Home file management.
 
 To use it, compile the program in 64 bits (to match the DLLs), and drag-drop the following folders into the exe folder :
 
 - BAT_SCRIPTS
 - BRUTEFORCE-xml
 - HELPER_FILES
 - NPD
 - ODC
 - SDC
 - unbar
 
 For now, Windows 64bits only. But this tool will be replaced shortly by a new solution, more versatile.
